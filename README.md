# Windows Utils
Welcome to my project "Windows Utils".
Here you will see a collection of scripts I find helpful when operating a Windows machine.
It is mainly repetitive tasks that save me time by automation

## I. Garbage disposal
The Garbagae Disposal script deletes all the items in the "Downloads" directory and empties out the Recycle Bin.
It runs in the background and triggers at 10AM. This way you start every day with a fresh trash can.
